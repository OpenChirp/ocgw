yodelgw for Debian


We no longer need the addtrustexternal.crt certificate, since the
ca-certificates package provides the exact same cert. It can be 
found at /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/AddTrust_External_Root.crt,
then the update program links /etc/ssl/certs/AddTrust_External_Root.pem
to it.
